<button class="accordion">User Research</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>My approach to User research is empathic, realistic and User-Centric. My aim in conducting user research is to strike a balance between how the users feel and what they would like to see in the platform while maintaining a realistic vision of how we may be able to collaborate to create a seamless and effective design. </p>

<button class="accordion">User Empathy</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The willingness to listen to users and gain more insight to where they are coming from is how I am able to effectively communicate with them as a designer. I enjoy seeing concepts from different perspectives and being able to bring them to life in the best way that I can. I specifically enjoy listening to users who highlight accessibility because I believe that it is important that everyone gets a chance to gain access to information </p>

<button class="accordion">Qualitative Interviews</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Gathering the necessary information from interviews is what primarily serves me as a designer. The information, perspective and insight of a user is key to effectively designing or re-designing a web page. Qualitative interviews stem from questions that aim to familiarize oneself with a user’s habits and questions that deep dive into a user’s needs while navigating an online resource. While working on a Government Website re-design it was very fascinating to note that color choices matter in terms of accessibility and visual dynamics.   </p>
