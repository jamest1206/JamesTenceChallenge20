                        option and an easy contact feature. Users also expressed that the color palette did not look too
                        warm and approachable except for the yellow elements.It was noted that blue, grey and black was
                        usually
                        associated with certain Government institutions as well as the Canadian Police force and that

                        relation to those sectors of society. Whereas shades of beige, pink brown and yellow were more
                        associated with Food Items and a sense of warmth and community.The research was conducted
                        through Google
